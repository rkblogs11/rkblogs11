<h1>July 2023 Blog</h1>
<h4>7/1</h4>
<h4>WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! There are so many sights to see and so many things to do!!! There are roller coasters, monorails, replica towers, and many more things! We are staying in the MGM Signature hotel and the room is very fancy.</h4>
<h4>7/2</h4>
<h4>Today we <strong>really</strong> tired ourselves out. First, we took a walk around New York New York, which was 8000 steps around the place. Next, we go to the pool and splash around. After that, we enjoyed a very tasty and relaxing dinner, with pizza. Then, we bought monorail tickets and went to the Circus Circus. But, the nearest monorail stop was .7 miles away. That was another 9000 steps. We used up about an hour but were sore and tired. Thus, we took a Lyft ride back to the monorail, back to the MGM, back to the rooms.</h4>

<h4>7/3</h4>
<h4>Today we went to the pool at MGM Grand, where they had a lazy river and a pool. After, we went to Paris (Las Vegas) and saw the (miniture) Eiffiel Tower (hope i spelled it right). While there, we got quite a few steps in. After Paris, we went to M&M World, where they sell a <strong>ton</strong> of M&M merch. Billy ended up getting a "custom" mug (it had his name on it but was not chosen by him). After going to the M&M World, we grabbed some ice cream and then went to a <em>fantastic</em> dinner show called <em>Tournament Of The Kings</em>. The show was lovely. It was also the last thing on our agenda</h4>
<h4>7/4</h4>
<h4>ITS THE FOURTH OF JULY!!!! Today we got to go to the pool one last time, the pool in tower 2 was better than the tower 3 pool, so we went there. Next, we went to dinner at a <em>fancy chinese restaurant</em>, where they had barely any edible food (for me). During the dinner, I managed to get Wyatts phone number, although I had to wait a while. Next, we went to the Fourth Of July Fireworks! They were shot off of the Ceasers palace at 9 PM. This was the last thing I did today.</h4>
<h4>7/5</h4>
<h4>We left Vegas, but vacation is not over yet! We went to Uncle Brians house and got some snacks. There was a lot in Vegas, but here it is chill.</h4>
